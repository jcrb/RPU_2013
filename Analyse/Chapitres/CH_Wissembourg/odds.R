# 
# Ce booklet vous apprend comment utiliser le logiciel R pour réaliser quelques analyses simples qui sont courantes en statistique
# biomédicale.
 
# En particulier il se focalise sur les études de cohortes et de cas-témoins, dans le but de tester si des facteurs particuliers sont
# associés à des maladies, des essais randomisés et méta-analyses.
# 
# Ce booklet suppose que le lecteur à quelques connaissances de base en statistique biomédicale, car l'objectif n'est pas d'expliquer l'
# analyse statistique biomédicale mais d'expliquer comment réaliser ces analyses avec R.
# 
# If you are new to biomedical statistics, and want to learn more about any of the concepts presented here, I would highly recommend 
# the Open University book “Medical Statistics” (product code M249/01), available from from the Open University Shop.

# Calculating Relative Risks for a Cohort Study

# 
# On appelle étude de cohorte une étude (prospective) de type longitudinale qui est généralement fondée sur deux groupes de sujets (les cohortes).
#
# One very common type of data set in biomedical statistics is a cohort study, where you have information on people who were exposed to some treatment or environment (for example, people who took a certain drug, or people who smoke) and also on whether the same people have a particular disease or not. Your data set would look something like this:
#   Disease 	Control
# Exposed 	156 	9421
# Unexposed 	1531 	14797
# 
# You can enter the data in R by typing:
#   
# > mymatrix <- matrix(c(156,9421,1531,14797),nrow=2,byrow=TRUE)
# > colnames(mymatrix) <- c("Disease","Control")
# > rownames(mymatrix) <- c("Exposed","Unexposed")
# > print(mymatrix)
# Disease Control
# Exposed       156    9421
# Unexposed    1531   14797
# 
# The relative risk of having the disease given exposure is the probability of having the disease for people who were exposed to the treatment or environmental factor, divided by the probability of having the disease for people who were not exposed to that treatment or environmental factor.
# 
# You can calculate the relative risk of having the disease given exposure in R, by using a function calcRelativeRisk(). To be able to use this function, just copy the following code and paste it into R:
calcRelativeRisk <- function(mymatrix,alpha=0.05,referencerow=2)
{
  numrow <- nrow(mymatrix)
  myrownames <- rownames(mymatrix)
  for (i in 1:numrow)
  {
    rowname <- myrownames[i]
    DiseaseUnexposed <- mymatrix[referencerow,1]
    ControlUnexposed <- mymatrix[referencerow,2]
    if (i != referencerow)
    {
      DiseaseExposed <- mymatrix[i,1]
      ControlExposed <- mymatrix[i,2]
      totExposed <- DiseaseExposed + ControlExposed
      totUnexposed <- DiseaseUnexposed + ControlUnexposed
      probDiseaseGivenExposed <- DiseaseExposed/totExposed
      probDiseaseGivenUnexposed <- DiseaseUnexposed/totUnexposed
      
      # calculate the relative risk
      relativeRisk <- probDiseaseGivenExposed/probDiseaseGivenUnexposed
      print(paste("category =", rowname, ", relative risk = ",relativeRisk))
      
      # calculate a confidence interval
      confidenceLevel <- (1 - alpha)*100
      sigma <- sqrt((1/DiseaseExposed) - (1/totExposed) +
                      (1/DiseaseUnexposed) - (1/totUnexposed))
      # sigma is the standard error of estimate of log of relative risk
      z <- qnorm(1-(alpha/2))
      lowervalue <- relativeRisk * exp(-z * sigma)
      uppervalue <- relativeRisk * exp( z * sigma)
      print(paste("category =", rowname, ", ", confidenceLevel,
                  "% confidence interval = [",lowervalue,",",uppervalue,"]"))
    }
  }
}
# This tells you that the estimate of the relative risk is about 0.174, and that a 99% confidence interval is [0.140, 0.215]. 
# A relative risk of 0.174 means that the risk of disease in people who are exposed (to the treatment or environmental factor etc. 
# that we are examining) is 0.174 times the risk of disease of people who are not exposed.
# 
# If the relative risk is 1 (ie. if the confidence interval includes 1), it means there is no evidence 
# for an association between exposure and disease. Otherwise, if the relative risk > 1, there is evidence of a positive 
# association between exposure and disease; while if the relative risk < 1, there is evidence of a negative association. 
# The relative risk can be estimated for a cohort study but not for a case-control study.
# 
# Note that we can also use the calcRelativeRisk() function in the case where we have more than one exposure category 
# (eg. smoking cigarettes versus smoking cigars, compared to non-smoking). 
# For this purpose it is used similarly to the calcOddsRatio() function (see below).

# Une étude cas-témoins (type d'étude observationnelle rétrospective) est une étude statistique utilisée en épidémiologie.
# Les études cas-témoin sont utilisées pour mettre en évidence des facteurs qui peuvent contribuer à l'apparition d'une maladie 
# en comparant des sujets qui ont cette maladie (les cas) avec des sujets qui n'ont pas la maladie mais qui sont similaires 
# par ailleurs (les contrôles)1. Les études cas-témoins posent donc la question : Y a-t-il plus de gens exposés à un facteur
#(par exemple plus de fumeurs) chez les cas que chez les témoins ?

# As well as the relative risk of disease given exposure (to some treatment or environmental factor eg. smoking or some drug),
# you can also calculate the odds ratio for association between the exposure and the disease in a cohort study. 
# The odds ratio is also commonly calculated in a case-control study.
# 
# The odds ratio for association between the exposure and the disease is the ratio of: 
# (i) the probability of having the disease for people who were exposed to the treatment or environmental factor, 
# divided by the probability of not having the disease for people who were exposed, and 
# (ii) the probability of having the disease for people who were not exposed to the treatment or environmental factor, 
# divided by the probability of not having the disease for people who were not exposed.
# 
# Again, for either a cohort study or case-control study, your data will look something like this:
#   
#   Your data set would look something like this:
#          Disease 	Control
# Exposed 	   156 	9421
# Unexposed 	1531 	14797
# 
# You can enter the data in R by typing:

#             Disease Control
# Exposed       156    9421
# Unexposed    1531   14797
# 
# You can use the following R function, calcOddsRatio() to calculate the odds ratio for association between the exposure 
# and the disease. You will need to copy and paste the function into R before you can use it:

calcOddsRatio <- function(mymatrix,alpha=0.05,referencerow=2,quiet=FALSE)

  myrownames <- rownames(mymatrix)
  
  for (i in 1:numrow)

      # calculate the odds ratio
      oddsRatio <- (probDiseaseGivenExposed*probControlGivenUnexposed)/
        (probControlGivenExposed*probDiseaseGivenUnexposed)
      if (quiet == FALSE)
      {
        print(paste("categorie =", rowname, ", odds ratio = ",oddsRatio))
      }
      
      # calculate a confidence interval
      confidenceLevel <- (1 - alpha)*100
      sigma <- sqrt((1/DiseaseExposed)+(1/ControlExposed)+
                      (1/DiseaseUnexposed)+(1/ControlUnexposed))
      # sigma is the standard error of our estimate of the log of the odds ratio
      z <- qnorm(1-(alpha/2))
      lowervalue <- oddsRatio * exp(-z * sigma)
      uppervalue <- oddsRatio * exp( z * sigma)
      if (quiet == FALSE)
      {
        print(paste("categorie =", rowname, ", ", confidenceLevel,
                    "% interval de confiance = [",lowervalue,",",uppervalue,"]"))
      }
    }
  }
  if (quiet == TRUE && numrow == 2) # If there are just two treatments (exposed/nonexposed)
  {
    return(c(oddsRatio,lowervalue,uppervalue))
  }
}

# L’odds ratio est toujours supérieur ou égal à zéro.

# Si l'odds ratio est :
# 
#     proche de 1, la maladie est indépendante du groupe ;
#     supérieur à 1, la maladie est plus fréquente dans le groupe A que dans le groupe B ;
#     bien supérieur à 1, la maladie est beaucoup plus fréquente dans le groupe A que dans le groupe B ;
#     inférieur à 1, la maladie est moins fréquente dans le groupe A que dans le groupe B ;
#     proche de zéro, la maladie est beaucoup moins fréquente dans le groupe A que dans le groupe B.

# If the odds ratio is 1 (ie. if the confidence interval includes 1), it means there is no evidence for an association between exposure and disease. Otherwise, if the odds ratio > 1, there is evidence of a positive association between exposure and disease; while if the odds ratio < 1, there is evidence of a negative association. The odds ratio can be estimated for either a cohort study or a case-control study.
# 
# We may also have several different exposures (for example, smoking cigarettes versus smoking cigars, compared to no smoking). 
# In that case, our data will look like this:
#   Disease 	Control
# Exposure1 	30 	24
# Exposure2 	76 	241
# Unexposed 	82 	509
# 
# You can enter the data in R by typing (notice that you need to type “nrow=3” now to have 3 rows):
#   
#   > mymatrix <- matrix(c(30,24,76,241,82,509),nrow=3,byrow=TRUE)
# > colnames(mymatrix) <- c("Disease","Control")
# > rownames(mymatrix) <- c("Exposure1","Exposure2","Unexposed")
# > print(mymatrix)
# Disease Control
# Exposure1      30      24
# Exposure2      76     241
# Unexposed      82     509
# 
# We can again use the function calcOddsRatio() to calculate the odds ratio for each exposure category relative 
# to lack of exposure. We need to tell the calcOddsRatio() which row in our data matrix contains the data for lack 
# of exposure (row 3 here), by using the “referencerow=” argument:
#   
#   > calcOddsRatio(mymatrix, referencerow=3)
# [1] "category = Exposure1 , odds ratio =  7.75914634146342"
# [1] "category = Exposure1 ,  95 % confidence interval = [ 4.32163714854064 ,
#                                                          13.9309131884372 ]"
# [1] "category = Exposure2 , odds ratio =  1.95749418075094"
# [1] "category = Exposure2 ,  95 % confidence interval = [ 1.38263094540732 ,
#                                                           2.77137111707344 ]"
# 
# If your data comes from a cohort study (but not from a case-control study), you can also calculate the relative risk for each exposure category:
#   
#   > calcRelativeRisk(mymatrix, referencerow=3)
# [1] "category = Exposure1 , relative risk =  4.00406504065041"
# [1] "category = Exposure1 ,  95 % confidence interval = [ 2.93130744422409 ,

# [1] "category = Exposure2 , relative risk =  1.72793721628068"
# [1] "category = Exposure2 ,  95 % confidence interval = [ 1.30507489771431 ,

# In a case-control or cohort study, it is interesting to do a statistical test for association between having the disease and 
# being exposed to some treatment or environment (for example, smoking or taking a certain drug).
# 
# In R, you can test for an association using the Chi-squared test, or Fisher’s exact test. For example, using our data 
# from the example above:
# print(mymatrix)
# Disease Control
# Exposure1      30      24
# Exposure2      76     241
# Unexposed      82     509

#  data:  mymatrix
#  X-squared = 60.5762, df = 2, p-value = 7.015e-14
# 
# > fisher.test(mymatrix)
#     Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data
# 
# data:  mymatrix
# p-value = 5.263e-12
# alternative hypothesis: two.sided
# 
# Here the P-value for the Chi-squared test is about 7e-14, and the P-value for Fisher’s exact test is about 5e-12. 
# Both are very tiny (<0.05), indicating a significant association between exposure and disease (using a cutoff 
# of P<0.05 for statistical significance).

# We can then use this function to calculate the dose-s
# You may have data from a cohort study or case-control study that is stratified, for example, the data may be separated (stratified) by the sex of the people studied. For example, we may have two different tables giving information on the relationship between exposure (eg. to a certain drug or smoking cigarettes) and having a particular disease. One of the tables may given information for women, and the other give information for men.
# 
# Data for women:
#   Disease 	Contr
# Exposure 	4 	5
# Unexposed 	5 	103
# 
# Data for men:
#   Disease 	Control
# Exposure 	10 	3
# Unexposed 	5 	43
# 
# We can enter our data into R as follows:

# Exposure        4       5
# Unexposed       5     103

# > rownames(mymatrix2) <- c("Exposure","Unexposed")
# > print(mymatrix2)
# Disease Control
# Exposure       10       3
# Unexposed       5      43
# 
# The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio estimates the odds ratio for association between the exposure and disease, 
# controlling for the possible confounding effects of the stratifying variable (gender here). 
# There is an R package called “lawstat” that contains a function “cmh.test()” for calculating the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio. 
# To use this function, we first need to install the “lawstat” R package.
# Once you have installed the “lawstat” R package, you can load the “lawstat” R package by typing:
#   
#   > library("lawstat")
# 
# You can then use the “cmh.test()” function to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio:
# > myarray <- array(c(mymatrix1,mymatrix2),dim=c(2,2,2))
# > cmh.test(myarray)
# Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square Test
# 
# data:  myarray
# CMH statistic = 40.512, df = 1.000, p-value = 0.000,
# MH Estimate = 23.001,
# Pooled Odd Ratio = 25.550,
# Odd Ratio of level 1 = 16.480,
# Odd Ratio of level 2 = 28.667
# 
# This tells you that the odds ratio for the first stratum (women) is 16.480, the odds ratio for the second stratum (men) is 28.667, 
# and the aggregate odds ratio that we would get if we pooled the data for men and women is 25.550. The Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 
# is estimated to be 23.001.
# 
# The cmh.test() function also gives you the output of the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Chi-squared, which is a test for association 
# between the disease and exposure, which controls for the stratifying variable (gender here). In this case, the p-value for 
# the test is given as 0.000, indicating a significant association between disease and exposure.
# 
# Note that if the we see very different odds ratios for the two strata, it suggests that the variable used to separate the data 
# into strata (gender here) is a confounder, and we should probably not use the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio. To test whether 
# the odds ratios in the different strata are different, we can use a test called Tarone’s test. To calculate Tarone’s test, 
# we can use functions from the “metafor” package. To use this function, we first need to install the “metafor” R package .
# Once you have installed the “metafor” R package, you can load the “metafor” R package by typing:
#   
#   > library("metafor")
# 
# We can then use the function calcTaronesTest() below to perform Tarone’s test.

#

# We can then use the function calcMHRatio() to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio for our data set:
#   
#   > calcMHRatio(mymatrix)
# [1] "Mantel-Haenszel ratio = 4.38461538461539"
# [1] "95 % confidence interval = [ 2.40054954520192 , 8.00852126107185 ]"
# 
# This tells us that our estimate of the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio is about 4.38, and a 95% confidence interval for 
# the odds ratio is [2.40, 8.01].
# 
# For a 1-1 matched case-control study, we can use a test called McNemar’s test to test for a significant association 
# between the exposure and the disease. We can use the function “mcnemar.test()” to carry out McNemar’s test in R:
#   
#   > mcnemar.test(mymatrix)
# McNemar's Chi-squared test with continuity correction
# 
# data:  mymatrix
# McNemar's chi-squared = 26.4143, df = 1, p-value = 2.755e-07
# 
# The p-value for McNemar’s test is less than 0.05, indicating that there is a significant association between 
# the exposure and the disease (using a p-value threshold of <0.05 for statistical significance).

#   
#   In a dose-response analysis, it is usual to have information on the incidence of a disease in people who were exposed 
# to different doses of some factor (for example, number of cigarettes smoked per day, dose of a certain drug taken, etc.). 
# For example, your data may look like this:
#   Disease 	Control
# Dose=2 	35 	82
# Dose=9.5 	250 	293
# Dose=19.5 	196 	190
# Dose=37 	136 	71
# Dose=50 	32 	13
# 
# We can enter our data into R as follows (note that you need to type “nrow=5” to tell R that there are 5 rows of data):
#   
#   > mymatrix <- matrix(c(35,82,250,293,196,190,136,71,32,13),nrow=5,byrow=TRUE)
# > colnames(mymatrix) <- c("Disease","Control")
# > rownames(mymatrix) <- c("2","9.5","19.5","37","50")
# > print(mymatrix)
# Disease Control
# 2         35      82
# 9.5      250     293
# 19.5     196     190
# 37       136      71
# 50        32      13
# 
# In this case, it is usual to calculate the odds ratio for association between each particular dose dose (level of exposure)
# and the disease, relative to the lowest dose. We can calculate these odds ratios using the following function 
# “doseSpecificOddsRatios()”, which you will need to copy and paste into R:
doseSpecificOddsRatios <- function(mymatrix,referencerow=1)
{
  numstrata <- nrow(mymatrix)
  # calculate the stratum-specific odds ratios, and odds of disease:
  doses <- as.numeric(rownames(mymatrix))
  for (i in 1:numstrata)
  {
    dose <- doses[i]
    # calculate the odds ratio:
    DiseaseExposed <- mymatrix[i,1]
    DiseaseUnexposed <- mymatrix[i,2]
    ControlExposed <- mymatrix[referencerow,1]
    ControlUnexposed <- mymatrix[referencerow,2]
    totExposed <- DiseaseExposed + ControlExposed
    totUnexposed <- DiseaseUnexposed + ControlUnexposed
    probDiseaseGivenExposed <- DiseaseExposed/totExposed
    probDiseaseGivenUnexposed <- DiseaseUnexposed/totUnexposed
    probControlGivenExposed <- ControlExposed/totExposed
    probControlGivenUnexposed <- ControlUnexposed/totUnexposed
    oddsRatio <- (probDiseaseGivenExposed*probControlGivenUnexposed)/
      (probControlGivenExposed*probDiseaseGivenUnexposed)
    print(paste("dose =", dose, ", odds ratio = ",oddsRatio))
  }
}

# We can then use this function to calculate the dose-specific odds ratios for our data:
#   
#   > doseSpecificOddsRatios(mymatrix)
# [1] "dose = 2 , odds ratio =  1"
# [1] "dose = 9.5 , odds ratio =  1.99902486591906"
# [1] "dose = 19.5 , odds ratio =  2.41684210526316"
# [1] "dose = 37 , odds ratio =  4.48772635814889"
# [1] "dose = 50 , odds ratio =  5.76703296703297"
# 
# Another common analysis is to fit a linear regression line between the log(odds of disease, given exposure) 
# and the dose, and to test whether the slope of the regression line is significantly different from zero. 
# If the slope of the regression line is significantly different from zero, it indicates that there is a significant 
# linear relationship between dose and the odds of having the disease, given exposure. We can fit the linear regression line 
# and test whether its slope is significantly different from zero using the following R function, doseOddsDiseaseRegression(), 
# which you will need to copy and paste into R to use:
doseOddsDiseaseRegression <- function(mymatrix,referencerow=1)
{
  numstrata <- nrow(mymatrix)
  # calculate the stratum-specific odds ratios, and odds of disease:
  myodds <- vector()
  doses <- as.numeric(rownames(mymatrix))
  for (i in 1:numstrata)
  {
    dose <- doses[i]
    # calculate the odds of disease given exposure:
    DiseaseExposed <- mymatrix[i,1]
    ControlExposed <- mymatrix[i,2]
    totExposed <- DiseaseExposed + ControlExposed
    probDiseaseGivenExposed <- DiseaseExposed/totExposed
    probNotDiseaseGivenExposed <- ControlExposed/totExposed
    odds <- probDiseaseGivenExposed/probNotDiseaseGivenExposed
    logodds <- log(odds) # this is the natural log
    myodds[i] <- logodds
  }
  
  # test whether the regression line of log(odds) versus has a zero slope or not:
  lm1 <- lm(myodds ~ doses)
  summarylm1 <- summary(lm1)
  coeff1 <- summarylm1$coefficients
  # get the p-value for the F-test that the slope is not zero:
  pvalue <- coeff1[2,4]
  print(paste("pvalue for F-test of zero slope =",pvalue))
  
  # make a plot of log(odds) versus dose:
  plot(doses,myodds,xlab="Dose",ylab="log(odds)",main="Plot of log(odds) versus dose")
}

# We can then use the function doseOddsDiseaseRegression() to test whether the slope of the linear regression line for log(odds) versus dose is significantly different from zero, and also to make a plot of log(odds) versus dose:
#   
#   > doseOddsDiseaseRegression(mymatrix)
# [1] "pvalue for F-test of zero slope = 0.00659217584881777"
# 
# The p-value for the test is less than 0.05, so there is evidence that the slope of the linear regression line 
# is significantly different from zero (using a p-value threshold of <0.05 for statistical significance). 
# That is, there seems to be a significant relationship between dose and odds
# of having the disease given exposure.

# 
# A common task in biomedical statistics is to calculate the sample size required, if you want to carry out 
# a randomised control trial with two groups (for example, where one group will take a drug that you want to test, 
# and the other group will take a placebo). 
# You can calculate the sample size required in each group using the following function, “calcSampleSizeForRCT()”, 
# which you will need to copy and paste into R to use:
  
calcSampleSizeForRCT <- function(alpha,gamma,piT,piC,p=0)
  {
    # p is the estimated of the likely fraction of losses to follow-up
    qalpha <- qnorm(p=1-(alpha/2))
    qgamma <- qnorm(p=gamma)
    pi0 <- (piT + piC)/2
    numerator <- 2 * ((qalpha + qgamma)^2) * pi0 * (1 - pi0)
    denominator <- (piT - piC)^2
    n <- numerator/denominator
    n <- ceiling(n) # round up to the nearest integer
    # adjust for likely losses to folow-up
    n <- n/(1-p)
    n <- ceiling(n) # round up to the nearest integer
    print(paste("Sample size for each trial group = ",n))
  }

# To use the “calcSampleSizeForRCT()” function, you need to specify the significance level that you want to have, 
# the power that you want to have, the estimated incidence of the disease in the control group (the group taking a placebo), 
# and the estimated incidence of the disease in the treatment group (the group taking the drug). 
# For example, if you want to have a 5% significance level and 90% power, and the estimated incidences of the disease 
# in the control and study groups is 0.20 and 0.15, respectively, then to calculate the required sample size for each group, 
# you would type:

# 
# > calcSampleSizeForRCT(alpha=0.05, gamma=0.90, piT=0.15, piC=0.2)
# [1] "Sample size for each trial group =  1214"
# 
# This tells us that the sample size required in each group is 1214 people, so overall we need 1214*2=2428 people 
# in the randomised control trial.
# 
# If we estimate that there are likely to be a certain fraction of people who are lost to follow-up, we can adjust 
# our estimates of the number
# of people required for the trial. For example, if we estimate that 10% of the people are likely to be lost to follow-up, 
# we can calculate the number of people required for the trial as:
#   
#   > calcSampleSizeForRCT(alpha=0.05, gamma=0.90, piT=0.15, piC=0.2, p=0.1)
# [1] "Sample size for each trial group =  1349"
# 
# This tells us that, if 10% of people are likely to be lost to follow-up, we need to have 1349 people in each group
# in our trial, so 1349*2=2698 people overall.

# 
# If, for practical reasons, you can only have a maximum of a certain number of people in each group of your randomised control trial, then you can calculate the statistical power that your trial will have. You can do this using the following function, “calcPowerForRC()”:
#   
calcPowerForRCT <- function(alpha,piT,piC,n)
  {
    qalpha <- qnorm(p=1-(alpha/2))
    pi0 <- (piT + piC)/2
    denominator <- 2 * pi0 * (1 - pi0)
    fraction <- n/denominator
    qgamma <- (abs(piT - piC) * sqrt(fraction)) - qalpha
    gamma <- pnorm(qgamma)
    print(paste("Power for the randomised controlled trial = ",gamma))
  }

# For example, to calculate the power of a randomised control trial involving 500 children (250 in the control group and 250 in the treatment group), where the significance level is 0.05, and the estimated incidence of the disease in the control and treatment group is 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, we type:
#   
#   > calcPowerForRCT(alpha=0.05, piT=0.2, piC=0.3, n=250)
# [1] "Power for the randomised controlled trial =  0.73303725668939"
# 
# This tells us that the power for the randomised control trial will be 73%.
